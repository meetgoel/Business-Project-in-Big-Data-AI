## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Streamlit

- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly
- **APIs**: TMDB API, OpenAI API
- **Data Processing**: pandas, numpy

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Git

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Business-Project-in-Big-Data-AI.git
cd Business-Project-in-Big-Data-AI
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not available, install the following packages:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas numpy scikit-learn plotly requests openai
```

### 4. Set Up API Keys

You'll need API keys from two services:

#### 4.1 TMDB API Key

1. Go to [The Movie Database (TMDB)](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
2. Create a free account
3. Navigate to Settings → API
4. Request an API key (choose "Developer" option)
5. Copy your API key

#### 4.2 OpenAI API Key

1. Go to [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or log in
3. Navigate to API Keys section
4. Create a new secret key
5. Copy your API key (you won't be able to see it again!)

#### 4.3 Configure API Keys

Open `config.py` and replace the placeholder values:

```python
# API Configuration
TMDB_API_KEY = "your_tmdb_api_key_here"

# OpenAI Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key_here"
```

> ⚠️ **Important**: Never commit your API keys to GitHub! Add `config.py` to `.gitignore` or use environment variables.

### 5. Prepare Data Files

Ensure you have the required pickle files in the `pickle/` directory:
- `movies_dict.pkl` - Contains movie metadata

If these files are not present, you'll need to generate them from your movie dataset.

## 🎮 Running the Application

Once installation is complete, run the application with:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "OpenAI API key not configured"
- **Solution**: Ensure you've added your OpenAI API key to `config.py`

**Issue**: "No module named 'streamlit'"
- **Solution**: Activate your virtual environment and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Issue**: Posters not loading
- **Solution**: Verify your TMDB API key is correct and you have internet connectivity

**Issue**: Slow performance
- **Solution**: Choose "Quick Overview" in Visualizations tab or reduce sample size in `config.py`
